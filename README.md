## Compiling

### Prerequisites

#### Windows

* **Microsoft Visual Studio 2022** with **Desktop development with C++** workload

#### Linux

* **CMake 3.24** or newer
* **g++ 11 or newer** or **clang++ 15 or newer**

### Compiling from source

#### Windows

Open **Osiris.sln** in Visual Studio 2022, set build configuration to **Release | x64**. Press *Build solution* and you should receive **Osiris.dll** file.

#### Linux

Configure with CMake:

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build

Build:

    cmake --build build -j $(nproc --all)

After following these steps you should receive **libOsiris.so** file in **build/Source/** directory.

### Loading / Injecting into game process

#### Windows

You need a **DLL injector** to inject (load) **Osiris.dll** into game process.

Counter-Strike 2 blocks LoadLibrary injection method, so you have to use a manual mapping (aka reflective DLL injection) injector.

**Xenos** and **Extreme Injector** are known to be **detected** by VAC.

#### Linux

You can simply run the following script in the directory containing **libOsiris.so**:

    sudo gdb -batch-silent -p $(pidof cs2) -ex "call (void*)dlopen(\"$PWD/libOsiris.so\", 2)"

However, this injection method might be detected by VAC as gdb is visible under **TracerPid** in `/proc/$(pidof cs2)/status` for the duration of the injection.
